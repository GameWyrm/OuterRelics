# Outer Relics
A mod for Outer Wilds that adds various Nomai Keys to the world which must be collected before the game can be completed.

Like most mods for Outer Wilds, this mod assumes that you have beaten the game before installing and reading this. There will be spoilers within this Readme. As Outer Wilds is best experienced with as few spoilers as possible, I urge you to click off this page and experience the game for yourself first before continuing if you have not already played it.

## Introduction
*As tensions and division arose between the Nomai during the construction of the Sun Station, concerns were raised over the security of the Ash Twin Project. While unlikely, it was possible for one to sneak into the Project and attempt to sabotage the Project's most precious component, the Advanced Warp Core. This would force the halting of the Project - and thus prevent the firing of the Sun Station. To prevent this, the ATP was set to lock itself in the event of disaster, and distribute 12 keys required to unlock it to trusted Nomai. But, when disaster did strike, when no Nomai were found, a bug in the system caused the Project to distribute the keys in random locations across the universe...*

Outer Relics adds up to 12 Nomai Keys in the Solar System, placed in random locations. The Ash Twin Project is locked down until all keys are found. The keys appear as holographic, glow, and give off a hum, so you'll know them when you see them. Collected keys are maintained across loops and are also saved (however, the save file is shared across profiles).

This mod (and readme) is still in development.

## Installation
There are no releases for this mod yet. However, you can currently install the mod and play through a randomized hunt. Try to find all 12 keys! Echoes of the Eye is required for the test, though it will not be required for the full release. No other mods are needed. 

To install, download the repo and copy the contents of the Mod Files folder (GameWyrm.ScavengerHunt and all the files within) to your Outer Wilds Mod Manager mod folder and enable the mod within OWMM. 

To uninstall, simply remove those files from your mods folder. 

## Compatibility
Outer Relics is designed to be compatible with any mod, except mods that delete major objects in the base Hearthian Solar System, or mods that make significant changes to the Ash Twin Project. You should be able to use it with Randomizer and most New Horizons addons. 

Quantum Space Buddies integration is planned for initial release. Key placement will be determined by the host file and keys will be shared.

Initial release will also include a system for defining custom key spawn points so you can have the Scavenger Hunt take you to user-made Solar Systems with New Horizons.
